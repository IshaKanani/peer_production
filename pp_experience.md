# Peer Production Experience Report
By Isha Kanani(ik3624)

### Introduction
The peer production participation has connected to may readings discussed in the class. While working on such environments comes with iy's own risks, I could see precautions taken for a few of them in the project I participated. The peer production community I indentified to work with is a GitHub repository of different Python codes. While writing the expectation initially, I aimed to add a new code to the repository, and also contribute to small tasks like cleaning the existing code, improving documentation, etc.

### Work Done
I started my participation with exploring the available repository and figuring out where can I contribute the most. The sub-folder where I decided to add a new python file is [machine_learning](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/tree/master/machine_learning). I spent some time develpoing a code that meets the community requirements, which was for the concept *principal component analysis*. However, I was working on a parallel project on *gradient boosting* using *grid search*, and the contribution of adding a code for the later concept seemed more valuable. I developed a [code](https://github.com/IshaKanani/Python/blob/master/machine_learning/gradient_boosting_regressor_grid_search.py) with the requirements, and created a [pull request](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/pull/1605).

The work submitted has **two steps** verification. The code submitted gets verified by the automated system as well as by a user with write rights to the repository.


| Pull Request #      | Pass/Fail Automated Test | Error  |  Approved/Denied/Pending By A User     |
| :---        |    :----:   |   :------:  |     ---: |
| Request #1      | Fail       | Format Error | Approved  |
| Request #2   | Fail       | Unused Package Error     |  Pending  |
| Request #3  | Ongoing |  NA   | Pending   |


### Comparison

The motivation of the participation was both fun and enhancement. Since working on Python is fun for me, but at the same time this project provided me with the opprotunity to ehnance my skills to work on similar projects in the future [1]. The tasks I had to complete in order to get my submission probably validated were a feq I did not know of while first understanding the project. The automated compiler on the repository took a few hours to compile the code, and since the contribution to the project was not made frequently, it resulted in time lag. 

While discussing Butler [2], I was confused by a few rules implemented in Wickipedia. However, through working on the participation project, it was made more clear why such rules were required. The project I chose required a user validation from the user who was write rights to the repository only, since that user will provide responsible contribution. While my code failed one of the automated test, I still got an approval from a user which I believe did not have write rights. This shows that maybe the users with rights will look more closely.
